# About me

<img src="../Images/profilepic.jpg" style="width:315px; height:315px; border-radius: 2%">

I'm Phuc; I'm pursuing B.S. in Cybersecurity Engineering at <a href="https://www.uc.edu" target="_blank">University of Cincinnati</a>. I love playing piano, video games and capturing pictures of life. 

Currently, I'm doing Coop at <a href="https://homepages.uc.edu/~wang2ba" target="_blank">Dr. Wang's</a> lab at University of Cincinnati, working on side channel attack on AES encryption inside microcontrollers. My work includes assisting other graduate and senior undergraduate student on the research, summarizing experimental results and research findings, implementing and training neural network for deep learning side channel attack, performing side channel attack based CPA on AES.

I have experience with reverse engineering and malware analysis using IDA, Ghidra, x64dbg, PE editor, PE bear. I also have experience with malware development using technique like DLL injection, thread hijacking, function hooking, Linux process injection with ptrace. I also have had sometime doing DFIR through practical labs.

Last summer, I had an opportunity working with <a href="https://viettelcybersecurity.com" target="_blank">Viettel Cyber Security</a>, where I had sometime doing log collection on customer's internal server for threat hunting operation later on. I also had a chance to watch operation in SOC, and learn about what's going on in real life industry. It was such amazing experience.

For future, my goal is to work in Blue Team. The distance from me as of today to a Blue Teamer is long, and there are still alot of things and experience I have to acquire. With that in mind, I'm looking for a Coop/Intern position in summer of 2025 to gain more experience.
